## Developer Environment Prerequisites
- Unity3d 2021.3 LTS
- Oculus Quest/Quest2
- Agora Developer Account

## Quick Start



This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.

  

### Obtain an App ID

  

To build and run the sample application, get an App ID:

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.

2. Navigate in Agora Console on the left to **Projects** > **More** > **Create** > **Create New Project**.

3. Save the **App ID** from the Dashboard for later use.

  

### Run the Application
#### Set up Unity environment for Oculus Quest
1. Clone this repo and open the project from this folder
2. Set up Unity environment for Oculus Quest ([see offical guide](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-gs-overview/))
3. Download the latest [Agora Video SDK for Unity](https://docs.agora.io/en/sdks?platform=unity)
4. Include [Meta XR Core SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/meta-xr-core-sdk-269169)
5. Import the UIHelpers package into the project.  See the [Release Section](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/Unity-VR-Samples/releases).  Without this, you can still build and run the project. But you can't use laser pointer to press buttons.
  

#### Build to Oculus
6. Open OculusRTCDemo.unity scene
7. Fill in App ID and Channel Name.  ![OculusRTCDemo-AppID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1261195/234465370-7a09702f-7429-43d7-8fea-6feb4b573149.jpg)

8. Make sure if your AppID has token or not.  Things won't work if you don't supply a token if your AppID requires one.  We recommend use an AppID for testing first before applying token logic.

9. Use [the Web Demo](https://webdemo.agora.io/basicVideoCall/index.html) as a second user to test the RTC call.
  
## Key Programming Notes
The demo uses the custom video stream push paradigm commonly used in situations where physical webcam can not be easier to activated with the SDK engine.  For the Oculus demo, a **RenderTexture** is used to contain the camera vision and provide the raw data to the [PushVideoFrame](https://api-ref.agora.io/en/voice-sdk/unity/4.x/API/class_irtcengine.html#api_imediaengine_pushvideoframe) API.   A ShareCamera object is placed under the **CenterEyeAnchor** to achieve the in-sync movement with the headset.  See the follow screenshots of these essentials setup steps:
